# Analysis-on-Corporate-Work-Patterns.

Through this analysis of 10,000 employees, we dig deeper to understand what truly drives productivity, and where things might be getting in the way.

Dataset was download from Kaggle.com and is designed for advanced HR analytics, machine learning, and organizational behaviour studiesThe dataset includes demographic details like age and gender, work conditions such as weekly hours, overtime, remote days, flexible policy, plus well-being metrics like stress level and work-life balance and of course, the productivity score



After Cleaning and Analyzing the data, i derived several insights like,

1. The average weekly hours of workers is 47.32. Employees are likely overworking, possibly under pressure to meet targets.
2. Based on locations, people in London, UK tend to have highest productivity ratings with the least being Berlin, Germany
3.Those with higher remote days have high work life balance
4. Employees working 5 remote days have higher total productivity compared to those with fewer or zero remote days.
5. Age Distribution in Productivity: Middle-aged adults and adults make up the largest groups across all productivity levels. Seniors show very limited performance contribution, possibly due to retirement or physical limitations
6. Salary fluctuates over tenure. No consistent upward trend, which is odd. 
7. The number of Workers in the various Job roles are almost the same throughout but surprisingly, the total minimum salary range for associates and interns are higher than that of Managers and Directors. 
8. Implication: This indicates a potential imbalance in the salary structure.Â 
9. Tokyo, Japan seems to distribute Salaries properly with the directors earning more followed by Managers but New York, USA does the vice versa




With the above insights, I gave recommendations as follows.

1.The current imbalance suggests entry-level staff collectively earn more than leadership, potentially demotivating key decision-makers. Reassess the salary structure to ensure Managers and Directors earn more than Interns and Associates

2.Globally, 40 hours/week is the usual full-time standard. Keep average hours below 45 hours/week, unless employees are highly engaged and well-compensated for overtime.

3.Encourage flexible or remote work policies because data shows employees with more remote days are significantly more productive and balanced.

4. Leverage the strengths of middle-aged and adult workers by placing them in key roles and mentorship programs, since they show the highest productivity ratings. Or Create training programs based on age group productivity trends where middle agers train the other age groups.

5. Investigate low productivity in Germany by assessing management styles, infrastructure, and employee satisfaction to identify and fix underlying issues. Or investigate best practices in London and try to replicate them in Berlin

6. Establish a consistent and motivating salary progression path across tenure to prevent dips that can demotivate employees and increase turnover risk.

7. Optimize project distribution across job roles to avoid underutilization and ensure maximum output from the available workforce.

8. Conduct regular salary and performance audits to maintain fairness, close pay gaps, and align rewards with actual contributions
